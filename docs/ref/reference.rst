pg_autoctl commands reference
=============================

pg_auto_failover comes with a PostgreSQL extension and a service:

  - The *pgautofailover* PostgreSQL extension implements the pg_auto_failover monitor.
  - The ``pg_autoctl`` command manages pg_auto_failover services.

pg_autoctl
----------

The ``pg_autoctl`` command implements a service that is meant to run in the
background. The command line controls the service, and uses the service API
for manual operations.

The pg_auto_failover service implements the steps to set up replication and node
promotion according to instructions from the pg_auto_failover monitor. Every 5
seconds, the keeper service (started by ``pg_autoctl run``) connects to the
PostgreSQL monitor database and runs ``SELECT pg_auto_failover.node_active(...)``
to simultaneously communicate its current state and obtain its goal state. It
stores its current state in its own state file, as configured.

The ``pg_autoctl`` command includes facilities for initializing and operating
both the pg_auto_failover monitor and the PostgreSQL instances with a pg_auto_failover
keeper::

  $ pg_autoctl help
    pg_autoctl
    + create    Create a pg_auto_failover node, or formation
    + drop      Drop a pg_auto_failover node, or formation
    + config    Manages the pg_autoctl configuration
    + show      Show pg_auto_failover information
    + enable    Enable a feature on a formation
    + disable   Disable a feature on a formation
      run       Run the pg_autoctl service (monitor or keeper)
      stop      signal the pg_autoctl service for it to stop
      reload    signal the pg_autoctl for it to reload its configuration
      help      print help message
      version   print pg_autoctl version

    pg_autoctl create
      monitor      Initialize a pg_auto_failover monitor node
      postgres     Initialize a pg_auto_failover standalone postgres node
      formation    Create a new formation on the pg_auto_failover monitor

    pg_autoctl drop

    pg_autoctl show
      uri     Show the postgres uri to use to connect to pg_auto_failover nodes
      events  Prints monitor's state of nodes in a given formation and group
      state   Prints monitor's state of nodes in a given formation and group
      ipaddr  Print this node's IP address information

    pg_autoctl enable
      secondary  Enable secondary nodes on a formation

    pg_autoctl disable
      secondary  Disable secondary nodes on a formation

The first step consists of creating a pg_auto_failover monitor thanks to the command
``pg_autoctl create monitor``, and the command ``pg_autoctl show uri`` can then be
used to find the Postgres connection URI string to use as the ``--monitor``
option to the ``pg_autoctl create`` command for the other nodes of the
formation.

pg_auto_failover Monitor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main piece of the pg_auto_failover deployment is the monitor. The following
commands are dealing with the monitor:

  - ``pg_autoctl create monitor``

     This command initializes a PostgreSQL cluster and installs the pg_auto_failover
     extension so that it's possible to use the new instance to monitor
     PostgreSQL services::

      $ pg_autoctl create monitor --help
      pg_autoctl create monitor: Initialize a pg_auto_failover monitor node
      usage: pg_autoctl create monitor  [ --pgdata --pgport --pgctl --nodename ]

        --pgctl       path to pg_ctl
        --pgdata      path to data directory
        --pgport      PostgreSQL's port number
        --nodename    hostname by which postgres is reachable

     The ``--pgdata`` option is mandatory and default to the environment
     variable ``PGDATA``. The ``--pgport`` default value is 5432, and the
     ``--pgctl`` option defaults to the first ``pg_ctl`` entry found in your
     `PATH`.

     The ``--nodename`` option is mandatory and must be set to the hostname
     that the other nodes of the cluster will use to access to the monitor.

  - ``pg_autoctl run``

    This command makes sure that the PostgreSQL instance for the monitor is
    running, then connects to it and listens to the monitor notifications,
    displaying them as log messages::

      $ pg_autoctl run --help
      pg_autoctl run: Run the pg_autoctl service (monitor or keeper)
      usage: pg_autoctl run  [ --pgdata ]

        --pgdata      path to data directory

    The option `--pgdata` (or the environment variable ``PGDATA``) allows
    pg_auto_failover to find the monitor configuration file.

  - ``pg_autoctl create formation``

    This command registers a new formation on the monitor, with the
    specified kind::

      $ pg_autoctl create formation --help
      pg_autoctl create formation: Create a new formation on the pg_auto_failover monitor
      usage: pg_autoctl create formation  [ --pgdata --formation --kind --dbname --with-secondary --without-secondary ]

        --pgdata            path to data directory
        --formation         name of the formation to create
        --kind              formation kind, either "pgsql" or "citus"
        --dbname            name for postgres database to use in this formation
        --enable-secondary  create a formation that has multiple nodes that can be
                            used for fail over when others have issues
        --disable-secondary create a citus formation without nodes to fail over to


  - ``pg_autoctl drop formation``

    This command drops an existing formation on the monitor::

      $ pg_autoctl drop formation --help
      pg_autoctl drop formation: Drop a formation on the pg_auto_failover monitor
      usage: pg_autoctl drop formation  [ --pgdata --formation ]

        --pgdata      path to data directory
        --formation   name of the formation to drop


pg_autoctl show command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To discover current information about a pg_auto_failover setup, the ``pg_autoctl show``
commands can be used, from any node in the setup.

  - ``pg_autoctl show uri``

    This command outputs the monitor or the coordinator Postgres URI to use
    from an application to connect to the service::

      $ pg_autoctl show uri --help
      pg_autoctl show uri: Show the postgres uri to use to connect to pg_auto_failover nodes
      usage: pg_autoctl show uri  [ --pgdata --formation ]

        --pgdata      path to data directory
        --formation   show the coordinator uri of given formation

    The option ``--formation default`` outputs the Postgres URI to use to
    connect to the Postgres server.

  - ``pg_autoctl show events``

    This command outputs the latest events known to the pg_auto_failover monitor::

      $ pg_autoctl show events --help
      pg_autoctl show events: Prints monitor's state of nodes in a given formation and group
      usage: pg_autoctl show events  [ --pgdata --formation --group --count ]

        --pgdata      path to data directory
        --formation   formation to query, defaults to 'default'
        --group       group to query formation, defaults to all
        --count       how many events to fetch, defaults to 10

    The events are available in the ``pgautofailover.event`` table in the
    PostgreSQL instance where the monitor runs, so the ``pg_autoctl show
    events`` command needs to be able to connect to the monitor. To this
    end, the ``--pgdata`` option is used either to determine a local
    PostgreSQL instance to connect to, when used on the monitor, or to
    determine the pg_auto_failover keeper configuration file and read the monitor
    URI from there.

    See below for more information about ``pg_auto_failover`` configuration files.

    The options ``--formation`` and ``--group`` allow to filter the output
    to a single formation, and group. The ``--count`` option limits the
    output to that many lines.

  - ``pg_autoctl show state``

    This command outputs the current state of the formation and groups
    registered to the pg_auto_failover monitor::

      $ pg_autoctl show state --help
      pg_autoctl show state: Prints monitor's state of nodes in a given formation and group
      usage: pg_autoctl show state  [ --pgdata --formation --group ]

        --pgdata      path to data directory
        --formation   formation to query, defaults to 'default'
        --group       group to query formation, defaults to all

    For details about the options to the command, see above in the ``pg_autoctl
    show events`` command.

  - ``pg_autoctl show uri``

    This command outputs the Local Area Network IP address of the current
    host, as discoverd by ``pg_autoctl`` and used to compute the CIDR to
    open in the Postgres HBA file.

    This command can be used to register the ``--nodename`` of the current
    node to the monitor at ``pg_autoctl create`` time.

  - ``pg_autoctl show cidr``

    This command outputs the local network CIDR address range as discovered
    by ``pg_autoctl`` and used when computing the connection privileges to
    grant in the Postgres HBA file.

pg_auto_failover Postgres Node Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Initializing a pg_auto_failover Postgres node is done with one of the available
``pg_autoctl create`` commands, depending on which kind of node is to be
initialized:

  - monitor

    The pg_auto_failover monitor is a special case and has been documented in the
    previous sections.

  - postgres

    The command ``pg_autoctl create postgres`` initializes a standalone
    Postgres node to a pg_auto_failover monitor. The monitor is then handling
    auto-failover for this Postgres node (as soon as a secondary has been
    registered too, and is known to be healthy).

Here's the full help message for the ``pg_autoctl create postgres`` command.
The other commands accept the same set of options.

::

  $ pg_autoctl create postgres --help
  pg_autoctl create postgres: Initialize a pg_auto_failover standalone postgres node
  usage: pg_autoctl create postgres

    --pgctl       path to pg_ctl
    --pgdata      path to data director
    --pghost      PostgreSQL's hostname
    --pgport      PostgreSQL's port number
    --listen      PostgreSQL's listen_addresses
    --username    PostgreSQL's username
    --dbname      PostgreSQL's database name
    --nodename    pg_auto_failover node
    --formation   pg_auto_failover formation
    --monitor     pg_auto_failover Monitor Postgres URL
    --allow-removing-pgdata   Allow pg_autoctl to remove the database directory

Three different modes of initialization are supported by this command,
corresponding to as many implementation strategies.

  1. Initialize a primary node from scratch

     This happens when ``--pgdata`` (or the environment variable ``PGDATA``)
     points to an non-existing or empty directory. Then the given
     ``--nodename`` is registered to the pg_auto_failover ``--monitor`` as a member of
     the ``--formation``.

     The monitor answers to the registration call with a state to assign to
     the new member of the group, either *SINGLE* or *WAIT_STANDBY*. When
     the assigned state is *SINGLE*, then ``pg_autoctl create postgres``
     procedes to initialize a new PostgreSQL instance.

  2. Initialize an already existing primary server

     This happens when ``--pgdata`` (or the environment variable ``PGDATA``)
     points to an already existing directory that belongs to a PostgreSQL
     instance. The standard PostgreSQL tool ``pg_controldata`` is used to
     recognize whether the directory belongs to a PostgreSQL instance.

     In that case, the given ``--nodename`` is registered to the monitor in
     the tentative *SINGLE* state. When the given ``--formation`` and
     ``--group`` is currently empty, then the monitor accepts the
     registration and the ``pg_autoctl create`` prepares the already existing
     primary server for pg_auto_failover.

  3. Initialize a secondary node from scratch

     This happens when ``--pgdata`` (or the environment variable ``PGDATA``)
     points to a non-existing or empty directory, and when the monitor
     registration call assigns the state *WAIT_STANDBY* in step 1.

     In that case, the ``pg_autoctl create`` command steps through the initial
     states of registering a secondary server, which includes preparing the
     primary server PostgreSQL HBA rules and creating a replication slot.

     When the command ends succesfully, a PostgreSQL secondary server has
     been created with ``pg_basebackup`` and is now started, catching-up to
     the primary server.

Currently, ``pg_autoctl create`` doesn't know how to initialize from an already
running PostgreSQL standby node. In that situation, it is necessary to
prepare a new secondary system from scratch.

.. _pg_autoctl_configuration:

pg_autoctl configuration and state files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When initializing a pg_auto_failover keeper service via pg_autoctl, both a configuration file and a
state file are created. pg_auto_failover follows the `XDG Base Directory
Specification
<https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`_.

When initializing a pg_auto_failover keeper with ``--pgdata /data/pgsql``, then:

  - ``~/.config/pg_autoctl/data/pgsql/pg_autoctl.cfg``

    is the configuration file for the PostgreSQL instance located at
    ``/data/pgsql``, written in the INI file format. Here's an example of
    such a configuration file::

      [pg_autoctl]
      role = keeper
      monitor = postgres://autoctl_node@192.168.1.34:6000/pg_auto_failover
      formation = default
      group = 1
      nodename = node1.db.local.tld

      [postgresql]
      pgdata = /data/pgsql/
      pg_ctl = /usr/pgsql-10/bin/pg_ctl
      dbname = postgres
      host = /tmp
      port = 5000

      [replication]
      slot = pgautofailover_standby
      maximum_backup_rate = 100M

      [timeout]
      network_partition_timeout = 20
      prepare_promotion_catchup = 30
      prepare_promotion_walreceiver = 5
      postgresql_restart_failure_timeout = 20
      postgresql_restart_failure_max_retries = 3

    It is possible to edit the configuration file with a tooling of your
    choice, and with the ``pg_autoctl config`` subcommands, see below.

  - ``~/.local/share/pg_autoctl/data/pgsql/pg_autoctl.state``

    is the state file for the pg_auto_failover keeper service taking care of the
    PostgreSQL instance located at ``/data/pgsql``, written in binary
    format. This file is not intended to be written by anything else than
    ``pg_autoctl`` itself. In case of state corruption, see the trouble
    shooting section of the documentation.

To output, edit and check entries of the configuration, the following
commands are provided. Both commands need the `--pgdata` option or the
`PGDATA` environment variable to be set in order to find the intended
configuration file::

  pg_autoctl config check [--pgdata <pgdata>]
  pg_autoctl config get [--pgdata <pgdata>] section.option
  pg_autoctl config set [--pgdata <pgdata>] section.option value

Running the pg_auto_failover Keeper service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the pg_auto_failover keeper as a background service in your OS, use the
following command::

  $ pg_autoctl run --help
  pg_autoctl run: Run the pg_autoctl service (monitor or keeper)
  usage: pg_autoctl run  [ --pgdata ]

    --pgdata      path to data directory

Thanks to using the XDG Base Directory Specification for our configuration
and state file, the only option needed to run the service is ``--pgdata``,
which defaults to the environment variable ``PGDATA``.

Removing a node from the pg_auto_failover monitor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To clean-up an installation and remove a PostgreSQL instance from pg_auto_failover
keeper and monitor, use the following command::

  $ pg_autoctl drop node --help
  pg_autoctl drop node: Drop a node from the pg_auto_failover monitor
  usage: pg_autoctl drop node  [ --pgdata ]

    --pgdata      path to data directory

The ``pg_autoctl drop node`` connects to the monitor and removes the
nodename from it, then removes the local pg_auto_failover keeper state file. The
configuration file is not removed.

.. _pg_autoctl_maintenance:

pg_autoctl do
-------------

When testing pg_auto_failover, it is helpful to be able to play with the local nodes
using the same lower-level API as used by the pg_auto_failover Finite State Machine
transitions. The low-level API is made available through the following
commands, only available in debug environments::
